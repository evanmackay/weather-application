# Search by City Weather Application

[https://evanmackay.github.io/weather-application/](https://evanmackay.github.io/weather-application/)

This is an application I built that will display the weather for any city that is searched.

## How the Website Works

Users can search any city in the form on the page. The current weather for that city will be displayed, as well as a five day forecast for the city. When the user refreshes the page, the last city's weather they searched will populate on the page and the city/cities that were searched for will appear in the 'Previously Searched Cities' portion of the app.

## The Weather

The weather information the user can see for the current day is a picture of the weather for that day, the temperature, wind speed, humidity percentage, and the UV Index. The text color of the UV index will change depending on whether the index is low, low medium, medium, high, or very high. The five day forecast will show the date and time the predicted weather will be, the icon for the weather, the temperature, and the humidity percentage.
